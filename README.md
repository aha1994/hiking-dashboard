Hiking Dashboard

View at: https://aha1994.github.io/hiking-dashboard/

## Spreadsheet Assumptions

1. The columns need to be in the correct order/placement.
2. The hikes need to be inserted in sorted date order with the oldest hike coming first.

## Backend Info

The code provided in `js/backend.js` is just a point-in-time reference that is not necessarily up-to-date with the actual backend.

The backend is also written in JavaScript and is hosted on Google Scripts so that it can have more seamless connectivity with the backing data stored in Google Sheets. It can be found [here](https://script.google.com/d/1468Bk901jpIpdXxu5Gnp4i4YXXQclZyOfx4tJ6h8zcAiGCjA32OqoSxL/edit).
